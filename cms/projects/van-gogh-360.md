title: 'Van Gogh 360: A Creative Journey'
f_way-of-work: >-
  Our design team began with thorough research into Van Gogh’s life and artistic
  style. We focused on his most iconic works, such as "Starry Night,"
  "Sunflowers," and "The Bedroom," to ensure that the posters would resonate
  with a wide audience. We used a color palette inspired by Van Gogh’s most
  famous works, incorporating vibrant blues, yellows, and greens.


  A blend of elegant serif fonts and bold, modern sans-serif fonts was used to
  balance the classic and contemporary elements of the exhibition. The event
  title “Van Gogh 360” was given prominence with a distinct, easily readable
  typeface.


  The layout was designed to guide the viewer’s eye from the central imagery to
  the essential event details, such as dates, venue, and ticket information.
  Balanced compositions with ample white space were used to prevent the posters
  from feeling cluttered.

The Van Gogh 360 event, held in Bangalore in 2023, was a spectacular immersive experience that celebrated the works of the legendary artist Vincent Van Gogh. The primary goal was to create posters that would capture the essence of Van Gogh’s art and the immersive nature of the event. The posters needed to be visually captivating, informative, and aligned with the event's artistic theme.
